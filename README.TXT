INTRODUCTION
This sample application is to show how to do background threading within 
an android application.

There are many more subtleties demonstrated by the application, but it
is also deliberately kept limited in functionality so as not to
obscure the important concepts behind a cloud of features and edge
cases.


BUILDING
The project directory is ready for use from either Eclipse.

To use Eclipse, install Eclipse, the Android SDK and the Eclipse ADT
plugin (if you haven't already, see
http://code.google.com/android/intro/installing.html for more details)
then start Eclipse, and create a new Android project. Use the
"from existing source" option, and browse to this directory. The
Android project should then be created, and you can browse the source,
build the application and run it in the emulator.
